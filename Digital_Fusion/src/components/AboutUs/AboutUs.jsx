          Welcome to Digital Fusion! Digital Fusion was founded by Imani Vera
          Walker, who recognized a critical need for leadership, positive
          influnces, and access to affordable resources within many communities,
          and felt compelled to make a difference. Our mission is to create
          meaningful opportunities for the youth, empowering them to turn their
          dreams into reality—at no cost. We believe that every child,
          regardless of their background, deserves the chance to explore their
          passions and access valuable resources.
        </p>

          Imani saw firsthand how many kids today lack positive role models and
          meaningful representation in the media. In response, we aim to fill
          this gap by providing the youth with the chance to connect with
          industry professionals and gain insight and hands on experince into
          the real world.
        </p>

          Through mentorship and collaboration, we inspire the next generation
          of innovators. At Digital Fusion, we focus on fields such as software
          engineering, UX design and marketing, allowing kids to work on
          projects that give them real-world experience. Our programs encourage
          collaboration and creativity, helping all the youth whether they face
          challenges or not—discover their potential and build a brighter
          future. Join us in our mission to uplift and inspire the youth in our
          communities. Together, we can create a world where every dream has the
          opportunity to flourish and every child has the chance to become
          great!
